# Monoid Code Scanning

This folder includes the OSS version of Monoid's code scanning features. A basic
set of config files to use with the scanner can be found in the `config` folder --
it does not have a complete set of scanning criteria by any means -- you'll likely
need to add your own sets of matching criterial.

## Configuration

If you want a pre-configured scanning tool, please [contact us](mailto:support@monoid.co), and
we can get you set up with the beta of our closed-source scanner, which includes a complete set
of configuration files you can use to get started.
