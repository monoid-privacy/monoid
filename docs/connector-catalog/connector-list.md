# Connector List 

This is a list of connectors currently available (either in the OSS repo, through a Monoid Cloud subscription, or in beta as a custom integration with existing customers) on Monoid. We're building new connectors every week; if you'd like access to a beta/premium connector, please reach out to jagath@monoid.co. If you would like a new connector to be created by the Monoid team, please create a Github issue or email jagath@monoid.co.
