# Welcome to Monoid Docs

### For Monoid cloud users

Monoid's cloud offering (and associated docs) will be publicly available on 11/30. Please [email us](mailto:jagath@monoid.co) if you'd like to get started sooner!

### For Monoid Open Source users

Check out the [Monoid Open Source QuickStart](monoid-open-source-quick-start/deploy-monoid.md) to get up-and-running. Then learn how to [deploy](/category/deploy-monoid-open-source) Monoid Open Source in your cloud infrastructure (deployment guides and one-click deploy for major providers are currently in development -- ETA 12/8).

Browse the [connector catalog](/category/connector-catalog) to find the connector you want. If the connector is not yet supported on Monoid Open Source, [build your own connector](/category/build-a-connector), submit an issue, or [sign up for a Monoid Cloud](https://monoid.co) to get custom connectors from the Monoid Team.

To get help with Monoid deployments, [email us](mailto:jagath@monoid.co) or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/monoidworkspace/shared_invite/zt-1jvlndiw6-l9~KhMXhG35OOgRqFGXnGg).

### For Monoid contributors
